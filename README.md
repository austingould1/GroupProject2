Project Summary: What is the safest state to drive in?

We are choosing to both analyze and visualize just how bad/good drivers are in states across the United States drawing upon
a variety of traffic related metrics and insurance data.





Questions to answer
Which state has the worst drivers?
Which state has best drivers?
Which state has the worst wrecks (fatalities)?
Which state has the highest citation rate?
Which state has the lowest citation rate?
Who needs this data? Who would find it useful?
How would we sell this? How to make it relatable?
______________________________________________________________


New Hampshire has over 50% of it's driver fatalities due to speeding according to "state speeding stastics"
Florida has less than 3%. 

Questions to use this data for, "who does this data help? Do lawmakers need this? Police need this?"
            -insurance companies, state and local police/fire departments

  -insurance companies, state and local police/fire departments
How would we sell this? How to make it relatable?
